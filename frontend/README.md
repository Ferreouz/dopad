## TODO

## General

- Put projects in separate folders
- Create project description
- Create project how to deploy

### Frontend
- image container with copy button X
- file container with download button
- when a text is focused I can paste text into him, else paste at the end
- when a text is focused I can paste image in the position choosen, to do this: you need to create a function to separate the inital Content into two and put the image content in between 
- copy button on the entire page to copy all text
- can upload a bunch of images and files at the same time

- See if you can modify or unify the divs so can select text from more than one div at the same time
- 'X' button to remove the image and unify the Content

- Create the socket

### Backend

- Create the socket
- Create DB
- Create API

### App

- See if app can have the copy button
- See how you can make it open/close the window with shortcut 


## Bugs

- when writing the cursor is going to the left, possible because the state is updating X
